MdCMS
====
Markdown CMS. Simple, no frills. (or database, or authenticationâ€¦)


Why?
---
I wrote this after being inspired by [mdwiki](http://mdwiki.info). I wanted
more control over the resulting html output though.


Installation
------------
None, zip, zero, nahda. Everything is rendered client side. All you have to do
is lob the directory onto some web host. You can even run this from a local
directory. Check out the examples or write your own.

Variables
